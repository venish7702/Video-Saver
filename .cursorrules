# Magic TIFF: iOS 26 Development Standards

## Rule 1: Visual Identity & Components
- **Framework:** Use SwiftUI 6+ exclusively. No UIKit unless explicitly requested.
- **Aesthetic:** Adhere to 'Liquid Glass' standards. Use `.ultraThinMaterial`, high corner radii (30pt+), and SF Symbols 7.
- **Hierarchy:** Prioritize large navigation titles and clear depth using `ZStack` and glass shadows.

## Rule 2: Architecture & Clean Code
- **Structure:** Enforce a strict folder hierarchy: 
  - `Views/`: Pure UI components.
  - `Models/`: Data structures (TIFF/PDF metadata).
  - `ViewModels/`: Logic and State management.
  - `Resources/`: Assets and SF Symbol constants.
- **Patterns:** Use `Observable` macro for state. Avoid old `@Published` patterns.

## Rule 3: Thumb-Zone & UX
- **Interactions:** All primary CTAs (like the '+' button) must stay in the bottom 30% of the screen.
- **Safety:** Respect all `Safe Area` insets, especially for floating glass elements.
- **Accessibility:** Mandatory `accessibilityLabel` for every icon. Support Dynamic Type scaling.

## Rule 4: Performance & Safety
- **Concurrency:** Use `async/await` and `Actors` for TIFF processing to keep the UI thread 100% fluid.
- **Memory:** Use `LazyVStack` for the document list to handle libraries with 1000+ items.
